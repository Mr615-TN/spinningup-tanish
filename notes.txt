@everyone

Dr Juan and I worked trying to fix my issues with the spinup install.


We first followed the steps below as I initially did not do that when I found my issues

mkdir –p ~/python/venv
mkdir –p ~/python/drl
virtualenv –p spup_env
source ~/python/venv/spup_env/bin/activate
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install libopenmpi-dev 
cd ~/python/drl
git clone https://github.com/openai/spinningup.git
cd spinningup
python3 -m pip install -e . 

When we ran python3 -m pip install -e ., we saw that it broke at 'tensorflow>=1.8.0,<2.0' as most of the versions of 
tensorflow that were available were all 2.0.8 and above.

We then had to manually install 'mpi4py', 'torch==1.3.1', and 'tqdm' by running python3 -m pip install mpi4py, 
python3 -m pip install torch == 1.3.1, and python3 -m pip install tqdm

We also checked if we had to install gymnasium again on the virtual environment by running python3 -m pip install gymnasium
Since it was installed, we ran pip3 list | grep gymnasium to basically copy it over to the virtualenv

First, we deactivated the virtualenv by running deactivate 

The we cd out of all the folders to then install poetry 

We then installed poetry by running python3 -m pip install poetry

Then, we cd into python/drl because we need to clone the cleanrl repo

We then ran the command git clone https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl.git && cd cleanrl as this clones the github repo as well as going into the cleanrl folder 

we then ran poetry install as it installs poetry into the cleanrl folder

If you want to use pip instead of poetry, then you can run pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt to install the requirements and install poetry system wide

We also ran poetry shell as none of the cleanrl environments will work outside of the shell

To test the shell and get the video version, Dr. Juan and I  ran the command python cleanrl/ppo.py \ --seed 1 \ --env-id CartPole-v0 \ --total-timesteps 50000 --capture-video

To see the video afterwards, we also had to install vlc by running the command sudo apt install vlc

To find the videos, we had to cd into videos as that is where the videos are

We then ran the command vlc CartPole-v0__ppo__1__1686859748/rl-video-episode-125.mp4 to pull up one of the videos

To run something like the Atari stuff , we would run the command poetry install -E atari 

and then run the command poetry run python cleanrl/ppo_atari.py \ --seed 1 \ --env-id BreakoutNoFrameskip-v4 \ --total-timesteps 50000 --capture-video
